# Hashes and the key/values of the hash often behave very differently. Keep in
# mind that the keys and values might not be hashes themselves, so pointing or
# executing commands on those will result in commands specific to the class of
# whatever element is pointed at. Hashes should have key-value pairs with a
# similar type (strings key, array value) instead of different types of key-
# value pairs.
