Bootcamp Repository
===================

This is a collection of all my ruby apps, notes and work done during the Metis
Ruby-On-Rails webdevelopment bootcamp powered by Thoughtbot and Kaplan.
Throughout the 12-week course, we've done work on many programming design
principles (DRY, Tell, Don't Ask, SOLID) while building skills on various
programming languages, extensions and ruby gems (Ruby, Sinatra, JavaScript,
jQuery, Ruby-on-Rails) as well as PostgreSQL.
