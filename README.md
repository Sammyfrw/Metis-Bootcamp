#Metis-Bootcamp Repository

##What is this?

This is my repo for my work completed during the Metis Bootcamp for ruby on
rails. It is currently going on up until Week 12 sometime late August. Feel
free to examine my code and leave comments. Shoot me an email at
sammyfrw@gmail.com if you want to contact me outside GitHub, or a private
message here.
